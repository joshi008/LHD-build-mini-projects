##What is Artificial Intelligence?

This is one of those buzzwords that interests many but people still don't know how it actually works. 
AI means the technology to power computer with the type of intelligence that the humans possess. In simple words the computer should be able to improve as same as the computer improves.

 Like when you go to the restaurant and orders the coffee â˜•, maybe once the sugar in coffee is too much for you so you tell the chef to make it low tomorrow. Tomorrow when you order the coffee, chef knows that yesterday you told him it was too much sugar but this time the sugar was too low. So you give a feedback and come back again.
We will notice that day by day the chef knows us very well and knows how much sugar we like in the coffee.

This technique is what humans possess till now but computers couldn't learn until machine learning was introduced.

Machine learning is a subset of AI. It is what we refer to as training a computer to teach it.

Computer usually takes in input as text or audio or file. And through machine learning we determine an output from it.

Now the applications of machine learning is very large.
